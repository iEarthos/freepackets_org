== objective

This document describes the system setup for the WRT54GL so it can be used as
a public access point that routes all its public traffic over a VPN tunnel.

== glosar

* public subnet: network that offers free internet access, used by the clients
of the WLAN accesspoint and the two VPNized LAN ports
* private subnet: network used for internal communication but can also access 
the internet

== basic function description

The router based on a WRT54GL offers a

* public WLAN accesspoint: traffic is routed over a VPN tunnel,
* two LAN ports whose traffic is also routed via the VPN tunnel and
* two LAN ports with direct internet connection to be used for the internal 
network.

The VPN tunnel is created using openvpn and the services offered by Cyberghost.
All traffic of the public subnet is routed over that VPN tunnel per __default__.
It is possible to switch the routing for the public subnet to a direct 
connection __without__ using the VPN tunnel.

Implications:

1. on router startup, the default route for the public subnet uses the VPN tunnel,
2. if the VPN connection dies, the internet connection for public subnet is 
interupted,
3. if direct connection for the public subnet is enabled, all connections
from that subnet appear as local connections on the WAN interface (==> so it 
looks like they are comming from the owner of the internet connection - and that
is (maybe) dangerous),
4. for safety reasons, if the openvpn deamon is stopped/killed/died, the
routing for the public subnet is switched back to use the VPN tunnel (=>see 2)

For security reasons three different subnets are used:

* 192.168.2.0/24: public subnet, could be accessed by everyone, can connect to 
the internet over VPN tunnel or dircect connetcion, can not connect to other 
internal networks,
* 192.168.3.0/24: internal subnet, used to connect internal clients/routers to 
the internet and
* outbound interface subnet provided by DHCP config over the cable modem.

== technical description

*TODO*

== files

=== configuration

See top-level README.

=== scripts

* build_package.sh - build an ipk-package containing the configuration and scripts to run the public access point
* build_firmware.sh - build the firmware including the package
